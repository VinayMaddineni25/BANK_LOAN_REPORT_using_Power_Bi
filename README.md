The dashboard and report provide a comprehensive overview of bank loan data, including the status of loans, the total number of applications, and the total funded amount. They allow for the application of various filters like state, grade, and purpose to view specific data.

In the dashboard, the middle section features pie charts that provide a visual representation of the proportion of good and bad loans issued. This visual aid helps in quickly understanding the loan distribution and identifying trends or patterns.

The report, on the other hand, includes a table in the middle section that provides a detailed breakdown of loan status. This tabular representation allows for a more granular analysis of the loan data.

Both the dashboard and the report have a section at the bottom that provides a detailed breakdown of loan status. This information is crucial for understanding the current state of loans and can guide decision-making processes.

Overall, both the dashboard and the report serve as valuable tools for analyzing and understanding bank loan data. They offer different ways of presenting the data, with the dashboard focusing on visual representation and the report providing a more detailed tabular breakdown. This combination allows for a thorough and multifaceted analysis of the bank loan data.
